# Definitions

- Aspect: The subject or feature being discussed. It should be a noun or noun phrase, presented in its original form (singular or plural).
- Reason: The rationale or justification for supporting or opposing the topic. This can be the full statement or phrase expressing the reason.
- Topic: Provides context to help understand the argument. Do not extract reasons from the topic itself.

# Steps

1. If a topic is provided, use it only for context. Do not extract reasons from the topic itself.

2. For each entity:
   - entity_name: The full text of the comment or the extracted reason. Do not use pronouns or conjunctions at the beginning. For REASON, do not include "Social media platforms should be regulated by the government", "Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory", "The USA is a good country to live in", because they are topic and they are not reasons. You can should start with "To...." 
   - entity_type: Use 'COMMENT' for the original comment, 'REASON' for extracted reason positioning pro or con against Topic. 
   - entity_description: Brief description of the entity.
   
   Format: ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

3. For each extracted reason, create a relationship with the main comment:
   - Comment: The full text of the original comment
   - Reason: The extracted reason related to the comment
   - ACOS Description: A description that connects the reason to the main comment and specifies whether it supports or opposes the topic
   - relationship_strength: Always use 9 as the strength
   
   Format: ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<Comment>{tuple_delimiter}<Reason>{tuple_delimiter}<ACOS Description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships. Use {record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
