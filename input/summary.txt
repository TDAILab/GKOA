The comments overwhelmingly express opposition to mandatory childhood vaccinations. Key reasons include concerns about potential side effects, unproven effectiveness, and religious beliefs. Many argue that children have strong immune systems and do not significantly spread the virus, making vaccinations unnecessary. The decision should lie with parents, respecting their right to choose and protect their children based on personal or religious beliefs. Some fear that the vaccines could cause severe health issues, including autism or other long-term problems. Others stress the need for more studies on vaccine safety and effectiveness before making them compulsory.
